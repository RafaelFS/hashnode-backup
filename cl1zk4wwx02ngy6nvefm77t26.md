## Disclaimers about this blog

So just some notes about this blog, to get them out of the way:

- This is my personal blog. Any views and opinions presented here are mine only and does represent in anyway the views of my employer or any other organization that I may be associated with, unless explicitly stated.

- This blog is not a portfolio. In no way it represents the full extent of my skill as developer. I may try to improve it over time for it to at least be something I am proud of. But it is starting as humbly as possible, using a platform and a prebuilt template. It is mostly and outlet to put into writing things that are in my head and having a place where I can quickly point to when sharing some of my opinions and knowledge. It is heavily inspired by the Digital Garden concept, [as Joel Hooks describes it](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden).

- English is not my native language. So, I apologize in advance for typos and sentences that does not flow that easily for native speakers. To be fair, even in my native language (Portuguese) I am fairly lenient with typos and grammar errors (I joke that I cannot proofread anything, my mind just autofixes any errors and I can't notice them).
